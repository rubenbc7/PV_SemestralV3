## Quick start

Before Game Foundation can be used during runtime, it has to be initialized in your code. 
The following is an example of initializing Game Foundation with the Start method of a MonoBehaviour.

```Csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.GameFoundation;
using UnityEngine.GameFoundation.DefaultLayers;
using UnityEngine.Promise;

public class MyGameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    IEnumerator Start()
    {
        // This data layer will not persist any data, it is usually used for examples or tests.
        MemoryDataLayer dataLayer = new MemoryDataLayer();

        // - Initialize Game Foundation for runtime access.
        // - We use a using block to automatically release the deferred promise handler.
        using (Deferred initialization = GameFoundationSdk.Initialize(dataLayer))
        {
            yield return initialization.Wait();
        }
    }
}
```

When you initialize Game Foundation, all managers, including `InventoryManager`, `WalletManager`, `TransactionManager`, and `RewardManager` will be initialized and ready to use.

**Tip:** To verify that Game Foundation is working and installed correctly, please null-check any Game Foundation manager.

```Csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.GameFoundation;
using UnityEngine.GameFoundation.DefaultLayers;
using UnityEngine.Promise;

public class MyGameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    IEnumerator Start()
    {
        // This data layer will not persist any data, it is usually used for examples or tests.
        MemoryDataLayer dataLayer = new MemoryDataLayer();

        // - Initialize Game Foundation for runtime access.
        // - We use a using block to automatically release the deferred promise handler.
        using (Deferred initialization = GameFoundationSdk.Initialize(dataLayer))
        {
            yield return initialization.Wait();
        }

        // Verify that the manager is initialized.
        if (GameFoundationSdk.inventory != null)
        {
            Debug.Log("Game Foundation is installed and ready!");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogError("Error:  Game Foundation was unable to initialize. Please check online help or docs for more information.");
        }
    }
}
```

After implementing the above code, when you press Play you will see that Game Foundation has been successfully installed and ready to build your game!
